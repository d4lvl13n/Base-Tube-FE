## Notes
- Successfully integrated Clerk for authentication, need to implement protected routes
- API integration for video display is working, but thumbnail rendering needs optimization
- Consider implementing lazy loading for video thumbnails to improve performance

## Next Steps
- Focus on completing the HomePage by adding the popular channels section
- Develop the ChannelPage component with dynamic routing
- Ensure DiscoveryPage is fully connected to the API for content fetching

## Challenges
- Ensuring responsive design across all components
- Optimizing API calls for better performance
- Handling potential CORS issues with API integration

## Ideas for Future Improvements
- Implement a recommendation system for personalized video suggestions
- Add a dark/light mode toggle for better user experience
- Consider implementing WebSocket for real-time updates (e.g., live streaming features)
