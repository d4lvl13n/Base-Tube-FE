# Base.Tube Brand Voice Guidelines

## Core Voice Principles

### 1. **Revolutionary, Not Evolutionary**
We don't improve platforms. We replace them.

❌ "A better way to monetize content"  
✅ "The first platform where creators actually own their economy"

### 2. **Simple Truths Over Complex Features**
Say the profound thing simply. Never the simple thing complexly.

❌ "Leveraging blockchain technology for decentralized content monetization"  
✅ "Your content. Your price. Your profit."

### 3. **Declarative, Not Defensive**
State the new reality. Never apologize for disrupting the old one.

❌ "We think creators deserve more"  
✅ "Creators keep 90%. Period."

### 4. **Human Economics, Not Tech Jargon**
Talk about money in your pocket, not protocols in the cloud.

❌ "NFT-gated video content with smart contract royalties"  
✅ "Sell access to your videos. Earn when fans resell."

## Content Guidelines by Channel

### **Website Copy**
Lead with paradigm shifts, not product features.

**Hero Example:**
"You don't need millions of followers to make a living. You just need the right fans and the right platform."

### **Social Media**
Start conversations about the broken system.

**Twitter/X Example:**
"YouTube: Create for years, hope for pennies
Base.Tube: Create once, earn forever
The choice is becoming obvious."

### **Creator Outreach**
Speak creator to creator. We've been there.

**Email Example:**
"Your 5,000 subscribers could be your full-time income. Not in 5 years. This month."

### **Ads**
Question the status quo. Don't just promote features.

**Ad Example:**
"Why do platforms keep 45% of what your fans pay? 
(They're hoping you won't ask.)"

## The Base.Tube Formula

**When writing any copy, ask:**

1. **Does it paint the new world, not patch the old one?**
2. **Would a creator feel this in their soul?**
3. **Is it simple enough for anyone, powerful enough for everyone?**
4. **Does it make the status quo feel absurd?**

## Remember

**We're not building a better platform.**  
**We're building the last platform.**

Every word we write should make that feel inevitable.
