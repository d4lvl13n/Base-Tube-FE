### Platform Availability

As Base.Tube prepares for its grand unveiling, we are committed to delivering an unparalleled user experience. To ensure the highest quality of service and community building, the platform will initially be available via an **invite-only system** during its early stages.

**Invite-Only Launch Phase**

* **Exclusive Access**: In the beginning, access to Base.Tube will be granted through a selective invite system. This allows us to cultivate a dedicated early user base and gather valuable feedback for refinements.
* **Gradual Scaling**: Starting with a smaller, engaged community helps us ensure stability and scalability. We plan to incrementally increase user numbers, carefully monitoring platform performance and user satisfaction.
* **How to Get an Invite**: Invites may be obtained through various channels, including early sign-ups, participation in our pre-launch campaigns, or via invitations from existing members. Keep an eye on our social media and official announcements for more opportunities to join during this phase.
