# Platform Mechanics - Introducing the NFT Content Pass



:

### **How It Works**

#### **Introducing the NFT Content Pass**

Imagine a world where your favorite creators offer not just regular videos but keys to a hidden realm of exclusive content. That's what we've created with our **NFT Content Pass**.

**For Creators:**

* **Monetization Fairness:** Even small content creators can earn income through NFT Content Passes, fostering an inclusive environment.
* **Complete Control:** Decide which content becomes exclusive and monetize it directly.
* **Continuous Earnings:** Receive revenue from both the initial sale and any subsequent trades of your NFT Content Passes.

**For Viewers:**

* **Exclusive Access:** Gain entry to special content—behind-the-scenes footage, interviews, and unique experiences.
* **Collectible Assets:** Own NFT Content Passes that can be kept or sold, potentially profiting from their increased value.
* **Active Participation:** Earn $TUBE tokens for engaging with content and participate in the platform's growth.

#### **A Hypothetical Scenario**

_Imagine Maria, an aspiring musician with a small but dedicated following. On Base.Tube, she releases a new song exclusively through an NFT Content Pass. Her fans purchase the pass to access not only the song but also exclusive behind-the-scenes videos and live Q\&A sessions._

_One fan, Alex, buys the pass. He enjoys the exclusive content and later decides to sell his pass on the marketplace. Since Maria's popularity has grown, he sells it at a profit. Maria earns from the initial sale and a percentage from Alex's sale, while Alex benefits financially and another fan gains access to the exclusive content._

_Maria monetizes her passion without needing millions of followers, and her fans actively participate in her success._
