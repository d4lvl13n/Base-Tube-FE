Below are some high-level suggestions to improve the mobile layout/user experience for Single Video and its related components. I’ll break them down by component and general considerations:
Overall Layout Adjustments
• Use responsive breakpoints (e.g., via Tailwind’s md:, lg:, etc.) to adapt spacing, font sizes, and layout elements for smaller screens.
• Ensure all large containers (like the video player or comments panel) have a max width/height so the user can comfortably scroll.
• Consider a single-column layout on mobile screens. For example, the video player is at the top, and underneath it, the user sees info, comments, etc.
RadialMenu (RadialMenu.tsx)
• On smaller screens, the radial layout can be tricky because it takes up space in all directions. You might convert it to a horizontal (or vertical) bar for mobile.
• Alternatively, give it a smaller size and ensure it collapses or auto-hides when not in use.
• Increase tap targets (the bounding boxes for icons) to at least 40×40 pixels.
CommentPanel (CommentPanel.tsx)
• By default, a side panel (slide in from the right) can be difficult on narrower screens. Consider making it a bottom sheet on mobile, or a full-screen overlay that slides up.
• Ensure any scrollbars or gestures don’t interfere with the main page scroll.
• Provide clear “Close” or “Back” actions, easily reachable with the user’s thumb (top-left or bottom area).
VideoInfoOverlay (VideoInfoOverlay.tsx)
• Keep the text minimal and easy to read (larger line-height, fewer lines, or a quick summary).
• Possibly hide or condense extra text behind a “Read more…” button if it’s long-form content.
• Make sure text sizing is comfortable on small devices (e.g., 14–16px base size).
CreatorBox (CreatorBox.tsx)
• On mobile, you could place the creator thumbnail and subscribe button below the video or inline with the video title.
• Consider making the avatar smaller or using a condensed layout to avoid overlapping or taking up too much screen real estate.
• Keep the subscribe button easily accessible, possibly wide enough to be tapped with a thumb.
